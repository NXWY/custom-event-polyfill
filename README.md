## Looking for an owner

I am not keeping up with this module as required, please reach out if you'd like to [take ownership](https://github.com/krambuhl/custom-event-polyfill/issues/16).

> [kumarharsh/custom-event-polyfill](https://github.com/kumarharsh/custom-event-polyfill) is doing a much more effective job at staying up-to-date, I would recommend looking at their module instead.
